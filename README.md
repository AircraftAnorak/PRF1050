# PRF1050

### Introduction
The **PRF10**, produced by Simoco/Philips, is a discontinued radio repeater that can operate at VHF or UHF frequencies depending on the model.

This GitHub repository documents the restoration process for **PRF1050** repeater that was once used for emergency communications to amateur radio frequencies.

I would like to state that in no way am I an expert on this repeater system, but a hobbyist who has gone through the system which was once non-operational to operational again, listing all my troubles encountered along the way.
